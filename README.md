EACH OF THE ITEM SOLD BELONGS TO ONE THE CATEGORIES: FURNITURE , OFFICE SUPPLIES OR TECHNOLOGY.


CONCLUSION AND INFERENCES:

1. THE SALES OF THE SUPERSTORE ARE DISTRIBUTED AMONG THREE SEGMENTS: CONSUMER, CORPORATE, HOME SUPPLIES. THESE SEGMENTS ARE SPREAD OVER FOUR REGIONS: WEST, EAST, CENTRAL AND SOUTH. EACH OF THE ITEM SOLD BELONGS TO ONE OF THE CATEGORIES: FURNITURE, OFFICE SUPPLIES OR TECHNOLOGY.

2. FURNITURE IS THE LOWEST CONTRIBUTING CATEGORY IN THE OVERALL PROFIT(ONLY ABOUT 6%). THUS, IT IS THE WEAK AREA TO BE WORKED ON MORE.

3. THE SUB CATEGORIES BOOK CASES AND TABLES ARE THE ONES WHICH CAUSE LOSS. THUS, THEY MUST BE DISCARDED FROM SELLING OR INCREASE THE PRICES TO MAKE PROFIT.

4. SUPPLIES IS THE SUB CATEGORY OF OFFICE SUPPLIES WHICH IS IN LOSS AND THUS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. MACHINES IN TECHNOLOGY ARE NOT MAKING THE CONSIDERABLE PROFIT(VERY LESS). SO, THEY HAVE TO BE IMPROVED IN TERMS OF MANUFACTURING COST TO MAKE PROFITS MORE.

5. LABELS, PAPER AND ENVELOPES ARE MAKING MOST OF THE PROFIT FROM OFFICE SUPPLIES. FURNISHINGS, COPIERS AND ACCESORIES ARE ALSO MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS OF PROFIT. ALL THESE MUST BE MAINTAINED IN A STATE HOW THEY ARE AT PRESENT.

6. CENTRAL AND SOUTH REGIONS ARE HAVING LESS SALES AS COMPARED TO EAST AND WEST REGIONS. THERE IS A NEED OF MARKETING OR AN IMPROVEMENT IN SHIPMENT PROCESS FOR THE EAST AND WEST REGIONS.



THE PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARISE AS A BUSINESS MANAGER FOLLOWING ARE:

1. SOME AREAS(LIKE BOOK CASES AND TABLES) ARE AT HUGE LOSS, THIS IS VERY CHALLENGING TO BRING THIS TO PROFITS. ALSO, IT CAN NOT BE DISCARDED FROM SELLING , BECAUSE IF IT IS DONE SO, THE SALES OF OTHER PRODUCT MIGHT GET AFFECTED.

2. THE SALES ARE UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED OVER DIFFERENT REGIONS. THUS, ITS A CHALLENGING TASK TO IMPROVE THE SALES IN CERTAIN REGIONS ( WHETHER TO CREATE FAITH IN PEOPLE OVER THE PRODUCTS OF THEIR STORE OR TO MAKE THE SHIPPING PROCESS BETTER).
